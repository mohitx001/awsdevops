Create a CodeBuild Project to deploy Cloudformation Resources as per SDLC Environment.

Push required Cloudformation Templates in Codecommit and run the Codebuild Project from specific Branch of Codecommit.

The Parameters for CF template should be given from AWS Buildspec Commands (aws cli commands)

Note: CF Stack Creation should happen with a CodeBuild Job.

Add CF Drift detection to only deploy to stacks that in IN_SYNC.
