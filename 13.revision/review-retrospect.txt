VPC 
	vpc peering : 
				1. send request 
				2. route table entries 
				
Nat gateway : uses elastic ip 
			: deployed in public subnet 
			: associated with private subnet 

IGW : 1:1 

Main route table : default route table : 


public vs private subnet :
							igw assigned for public 
							auto assign public ip for public subnet is enabled 
							

vpc Endpoints : access aws services without internet 
				gateway and interface 
				

Transit gateway : associations : VPC attachments 
				: propagations : other vpc 
				Resource access manager : transit gateway needs to be shared with other account 
				
VPN tunnel: on premise to aws using private network
