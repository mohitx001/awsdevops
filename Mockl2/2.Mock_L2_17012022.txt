Linux , DevOps and AWS
1. Devops Workflow (Code to Deployment : Git -> Build service -> deployment -> Servers)
2. Git scenarios : branching, merging strategy, Pull Requests , git best practices, ssh and https authentication, branch access policies.
3. Cloudformation Scenarios and Implementation ( Sections, Intrinsic Functions, Output, export, import, Drift Detection, automate drift detection (python boto3, shell script))
4. IAC Automation : Git -> Codebuild -> CF -> Deploy stacks as per SDLC environment
5. Explain AWS CICD implementation ( CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline )
6. Yum package manager
4. Shell scripting scenarios ( bash scripts, awk, sed, for, if else)
5. Python Scripting ( Lambda boto3 examples )
8. Firewalld configuration scenarios, Network config changes , SG, NACL, Linux
11. Devops Best Practices that are followed.
	Using Env Variables, parameters to make code generic, no storing sensitive information in code.

AWS Troubleshooting:
	- Load balancer : route ec2 -> retry the connection , every 5 sec, 5 times, unhealthy
	- Troubleshooting of LB and EC2 instance network.
- Cloudwatch custom metrics, cloudwatch agent will be installed on your EC2, linux logs to be pushed in cloudwatch logs in the log group.
	▪ How to configure custom cloudwatch metrics ( cw daemon, script that will post logs from ec2 to log group )
	- nginx , httpd => /var/log/nginx/access.log
						/var/log/nginx/error.log
						/var/log/httpd/access.log
						/var/log/httpd/error.log
				- cat access.log | grep '10.10*' | wc -l
	▪ I want to monitor OS metrics (memory utilization ) and performance counters of my amazon linux instance.
Linux : 
	sed, awk utilities
	How to use command line arguments in a Script?

	What is Shell Redirection Operators?
	What is crontab in Linux, how to set a cronjob?
	How to Debug a Shell Script? bash -x script.sh
	How to find all the files modified in the last 5 days and save the result in a text file?
	ctime , mtime , atime for files
	I want to install a package and is failing, what are the troubleshooting steps that you will follow
	which port curl command connects, and on which port u get the response
	How to kill process, telnet, check load on server, netstat, nmap, nc commands, nslookup
	What all things ssh needs for authentication
	- if your private key is lost.
	▪ List of open ports?
	▪ What does nslookup and netstat?
	▪ What is process? How to kill process? How to get PID?
	▪ What is the use of du command?

Linux scenario questions :
	- Command to find all files in a directory with more than 1GB
	- get the size of all files and folders in a particular directory
	- list the files that are modified in the last 3 days.
	- check process run by a particular user
	- how to check cpu utilization and memory utilization in linux ( free -m , top )
	- zip files in linux older than 1 month.
	▪ Write the shellscript for count of IP Address from file?
	▪ How to access EC2 instance, if pem file is lost?
	- what types of error codes find if you enable ELB LOGS, What is meaning of what error code, 
	- What is 2xx ? What is 3xx? what is 4xx? What is 5xx?
		200 OK - Success
		300 - Redirection Messages
		400 - Client Error Messages
			- 403 Forbidden
			- 404 Not Found
			- Request Timed Out
		500 - Server Error Messages

IAC: Infrastructure as a Code
	- CloudFormation ( template.yml , template.json ) -> AWS Account ( resource provisioning definition )
		( Sections, Intrinsic Functions, Output, export, import, Drift Detection, automate drift detection)
	- Terraform ( AWS , Azure , GCP ) (  template.tf ) -> ( resource provisioning definition )

IAC Automation:
	- Git -> Codebuild -> CF -> Deploy
		Network stack
		IAM Stack
		EC2 Stack

Application Deployment Automation
▪ CICD Pipeline
▪ Jenkins 

Scripting:
	- Shell Script ( bash scripts, awk, sed, for, if else, aws cli commands and filter)
		shell script -> csv file sg inbound: filename, region, security group name
			Command Line Arguments: $1, $2, $3
	- Python Script ( list, dictionary, tuple, for, modules, boto3 -> aws sdk, ) Lambda 
		Python script using Boto3
		1)Write python script for send an email notification When a specific Instance(s) stops in the production environment
		2)Write Python script to find unused volume and send an email notification
		3)Write python script to find unused EIPs
		4)How to automatically tag EC2 instance after its launched and if its not tagged?
		(Ans:  create cloudwatch event pattern using API Call via CloudTrail and trigger lambda function, write python code for creating tag in the lambda function)

Logging:
	Query S3 Bucket Files -> Athena
		VPC Flow Logs -> S3 bucket
		CloudTrail Logs -> S3 bucket
		ELB Logs -> S3 bucket
		S3 Access logs -> S3 bucket

Ansible
▪ What is Inventory and where the inventory file?
▪ What is Ansible Role?
▪ What is Module?
▪ Using Ansible, if any application is installed, how to check and troubleshoot the installation/configuration of that application.
▪ How to define inventory in Ansible
▪ parameters in ansible.cfg

	Kubernetes
		kubectl create deployments -f deployment.yaml
	- Setup a EKS Cluster.
	- Application Build Pipeline and Deployment into kubernetes

========================================
Jenkins:
	- Github
		git-repo:
			java-tomcat-sample
				src/
				
	- Jenkins Job -> mvn clean install -> target/java-tomcat-sample.war
	- java-tomcat-sample.war -> deploy this to target Tomcat EC2 instances
		/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/java-tomcat-sample.war
	- UI for Tomcat
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
git-repo:
	java-tomcat-sample
		src/
	1. mvn clean install -> target/java-tomcat-sample.war
	2. Copy this war file into Docker Image.

Docker Containers -> Tomcat

EKS Cluster:

-> Application ( Java -> maven build -> .war -> Docker image Created ( Copy war file inside your docker )
	- docker build -> Dockerfile -> Image -> push image into image registry ( Docker Hub )
	- kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

Done:

------------------------------------
IAC Creation : Ticket ( Ticket Management Tools ) : Jira, Service Now.
- develop that code
- Raise PR -> Reviewed ( Comments , address changes  ) Approved -> merge -> develop -> -> Execute Job from develop branch into qa environment
- test and deploy it into production

feature -> code changes -> deploy dev -> complete -> raise a PR from feature into develop -> approved -> merged -> develop -> deploy into qa -> test if it works -> raise another PR to merge develop into main -> approved -> merged -> main -> deployment ( main into prod environment )

-----------------------------
Ticket Number -> CA-123 , CA-145
Branch : CA-123_s3_setup
Branch : CA-123_s3_setup_changes

Task Description:
- Create 3 buckets using Cloudformation

Acceptance Criteria:
- Create s3 buckets using CF template with deployment scripts as per SDLC Setup
=======================
Clients : AWS Account Creation.
2 types of accounts:
development AWS Account:
	- dev team ( dev, qa environment )
	- dev-s3 bucket
	- dev-lambda-function -> iam role of lambda -> dev-s3
Production AWS Account:
	- prod environment -> prod-s3 bucket policy : Principal ( arn of role of dev lambda function ) 

1 AWS Account ( dev, qa, prod )

Initially setup users , access to specific services
