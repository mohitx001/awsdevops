PFA Steps for CF and CF with SSM.
Python Lambda CF Automation Scenario: Drift Detection Automation

Create a CSV containing a list of all Active CloudFormation Stacks that has Drift status as DRIFTED/In-Sync, also specifying the resources present in the CF stack and send a notification daily at 9am.  

Note:
Use Lambda boto3 client object for cloudformation

Write a for loop to get a list of all the CloudFormation Stacks with CREATE_COMPLETE and UPDATE_COMPLETE state.

Execute the detect_stack_drift function using cloudformation boto3 object to detect drift for a stack

Use describe_stack_drift_detection_status function to get the status of the stack.

Create a list in python if the stack status is DRIFTED.

Mail this list using SNS Topic publish function

Schedule above lambda using CW Event Rule.
